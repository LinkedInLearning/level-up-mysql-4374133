MySQL is one of the most common databases in the world and there’s a lot of value in gaining experience with it. Join instructor Brad Wheeler in this course for a series of challenges, framed in real-life scenarios, that will test your MySQL skill and show you some new tricks. In the first half of the course, Brad presents a messy, incomplete database that you’ll have to turn into orderly, usable data. In the second half, you’ll use the newly-reorganized database to learn about a fictional company’s employees and customers—with the challenges getting more involved as you go. Try the challenges, compare your solution to Brad’s answers, and gain confidence in thinking through and solving database problems using realMySQL tools.
